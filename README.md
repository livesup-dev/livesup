    We live in the Cloud era, today's applications are about connecting APIs. To manage, monitor, control your app, teams and business you probably need to log in into 10 different services (or more!). It's even harder if you just joined the organization or switched to a new team. LiveSup tries to add transparency to the services you use and it creates a layer that organizes and simplifies the information you need when you need it.

## Business Goals

* Have fun!
* Add transparency to the existing services in your organization/team
* Remove the need to access several services to have a sense of what's going on with your business/app/teams.
* Help onboarding people to the team/organization.
* Drive meetings exposing data that was not available before (easily). 

## Technical Goals

Besides the "business goal" mentioned above there are also a few technical goals behind this development. 

* Have fun!
* Learn Elixir
* Build a rich and dynamic application without javascript (or as little as possible)
* Build a more "complex" and "real" application that helps others understand that you can do much more than just a chat or a ToDo app with a Elixir/phoenix :)

## What is Livesup?

![](/docs/images/dashboard-full.png)

Livesup is an application that lets you concentrate information from different services or datastores in a dashboard. The information is displayed with predefined widgets. Each widget is responsible for reading and displaying the data correctly. For instance the `Github Pull Requests` widget will fetch the last n open/close pull requests from a repository and will display accordingly.

The app has 3 main "sections": 
* An API(/api) that let you perform some actions like:
  * Manage users
  * Manage teams
  * Manage projects
  * [Seeding](#seeding)
* The "front end" (/)
* The backend (/admin)

## What is it not?

Livesup is NOT meant to replace any of the datasources it consumes. It is not meant to be used as a debugging tool or an advanced troubleshooting service.

## How data is structure

Livesup has a very flexible data structure that lets you organize the data in the way you want. The top level component is a "Project". A Project can be part of more projects (the current UI only supports one level of projects), and it can have several dashboards, each dashboard has widgets. 

![](/docs/images/projects-data-structure.png)

The relationship between users and projects, is controlled by `Groups`. A Group can have many projects and users. So you can control who can see what. New signup will be associated to a default group called `All Users`. And any new project will be associated to that group by default, meaning that when you create a project it will become available to all existing users.

## Building and running Livesup localy

If you already have a Postgres server running you can just use the following, replacing the envs with your values

```
docker run --rm \
    -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@docker.for.mac.localhost:5432/livesup \
    -e PGHOST=docker.for.mac.localhost \
    -e PGPORT=5432 \
    -e PGUSER=postgres \
    -e PGPASSWORD=postgres \
    -e PGDATABASE=livesup \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    --pull always \
    livesup:edge
```

Or you could just do `docker-compose up` using the existing [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file.

## Seeding

Since we don't have a proper UI yet to manage all the components. The easiest way to seed the app is to use a YAML definition. You can see the demo [here](/docs/demo-seed.yaml). 
 
There are 2 ways you can import that file. 
* Console

Log in into the console and do: 

```
YamlElixir.read_from_file('docs/demo-seed.yaml')
|> LiveSup.LiveSup.DataImporter.Importer.import()
```

* API

To use the API you first need to have a valid token, to do that, you can use the following curl command (change the host accordingly):

```
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:4000/api/sessions' \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "email": "emiliano@summing-up.com",
    "password": "Very@Safe@Password"
}'
```

Grab the token and convert the yaml file into json. You can use `jq --raw-input --slurp < demo-seed.yaml`

```
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:4000/api/seed' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN-HERE' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "data":"....."
  }'
```
