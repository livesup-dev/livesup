# Introduction

### Greetings, contributor!

Thank you for considering contributing to LiveSup. We're happy to have you!

### Types of contributions we're looking for

The best way to contribute is to take a look at our current backlog and work on a story that you're most excited about. Please take a look at the [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/livesup-dev/projects/1) for viewing the backlog. Bug fixes and documentation improvements are also welcome.

# Code of Conduct
Please read our [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md) before contributing.

# First time contributing?
Unsure where to begin contributing to LiveSup? You can start by looking through [issues](https://github.com/livesup-dev/livesup/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) that have the "good first issue" label.

# Getting started
* Before you start coding, please see the [Developer Guide](docs/develop/guide.md) for information about getting set up and running the tests.

Once you're ready to start coding:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Make the necessary changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Make a pull request, and be sure to fill out the information in the template.


# How to report a bug
### Security issues
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. DM us instead, you can use our [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/livesup-community/shared_invite/zt-1f6hn8log-QrrgQfaTpunxxMXf9U8MuA).

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

### For non-security issues
Please open an issue and use the template provided. Please add the "type:bug" label.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
Before suggesting a feature, please read through the [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/livesup-dev/projects/2) and check the backlog to make sure that the story doesn't exist already. Once you're ready to suggest the feature or enhancement, open an issue and use the provided template. Please also add the "type:feature-request" label or go to the [New features or Enhancements discussion](https://github.com/livesup-dev/livesup/discussions/categories/new-features-or-enhancements)

# Code review process
After you submit your pull request, it will be reviewed asap and we will give you feedback on any needed changes. After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
